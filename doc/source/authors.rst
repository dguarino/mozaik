In addition the code present in the file mozaik/tools/stgen.py has been copied from the 
NeuroTools package (http://neuralensemble.org/NeuroTools). Specifically the function 
inh_poisson_generator was copied, which dependes on the source code located in the neurotools/stgen.py 
and neurotools/signals/spikes.py files. This has been done to minimize the list dependencies
form Mozaik, considering that only single function of the NeuroTools package was used.
We would like to thank all authors of NeuroTools for sharing this excellent neural
signal analysis package.

If we've somehow missed you off the list we are very sorry - please let us know.
